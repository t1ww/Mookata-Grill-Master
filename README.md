# Mookata Grill Master
just my hobby project

This will be a roblox project for fun.

# General idea of the game
- Mookata Tycoon is a management and simulation game where players run a mookata (Thai-style grill) business. Players start by buying pork and gradually unlock pig farming to control meat quality and texture. The core gameplay loop involves feeding pigs, processing meat, marinating for flavor, cooking, and serving customers.

- Customers are procedurally generated with preferences for flavor and texture, and their satisfaction affects tips, eating speed, and even chaos events. Players can experiment with ingredients and feeds to influence flavor profiles and meat textures, creating unique combinations.

- The game also includes mutations triggered by environmental events, optional chaos mechanics like overeating or machine overload, and progression systems that unlock automation, better tools, secret recipes, and upgraded cooking pans.

- The goal is to maximize customer satisfaction, manage resources efficiently, and expand your mookata empire through experimentation, strategic upgrades, and clever utilization of mutations.
